## 🎬 Your 50-Minute Class Demo

**Timeline:**
- 0-5 min: Intro slides + "What is blockchain?"
- 5-15 min: Demo #1 (Live Dashboard)
- 15-25 min: Demo #2 (QR Scanner) — students scan codes
- 25-35 min: Demo #3 (Batch Recall) — watch things turn red
- 35-45 min: Optional: Audit Trail or Counterfeit Game
- 45-50 min: Q&A + "Next steps: You'll build features like these!"

**Wow Moments:**
1. Transaction appears in real-time (immutability)
2. QR code shows complete history (traceability)
3. Admin clicks recall, everything cascades (enforcement)
4. Students vote on which medicine is fake (engagement)

## 📞 Support Resources

All resources are in your workspace:

- **Full Specs:** `/docs/NEW_FEATURES_PLAN.md`
- **Quick Ref:** `/QUICK_START.md`
- **Visual Map:** `/FEATURE_ROADMAP_VISUAL.md`
- **Summary:** `/FEATURES_SUMMARY.md`

## 🎯 Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 1 (2 weeks), you should have:
- ✅ Live Transaction Dashboard working
- ✅ QR Scanner fully functional
- ✅ Batch Recall feature complete
- ✅ Zero console errors
- ✅ <2 second load time
- ✅ 50-minute demo runs perfectly
- ✅ Demo video recorded
- ✅ Ready for classroom presentation

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Phase 1** — Get a working demo before adding complexity
2. **Use staging environment** — Test features on testnet first
3. **Pair programming** — Complex features like Simulator benefit from 2 devs
4. **Document as you go** — Teaching guides will be easier later
5. **Record demos** — Save videos for marketing + student reference
6. **Get feedback early** — Show prototypes to teachers/students
7. **Test on multiple devices** — QR scanner must work on phones
8. **Secure credentials** — Never commit private keys or API tokens

---

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

**All documentation is ready to use.**

Pick Phase 1 (Dashboard + QR + Recall), assign team members, and you'll have a production-ready demo in 2 weeks.

Good luck! 🎉
