# BlockMed V2 - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Smart Contract Address (required)
# Set this to your deployed contract address so the app always reads the same data.
# After deploy, run: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
# Then paste the printed address here. Old data is never deleted on-chain; it stays
# at this address. See BLOCKCHAIN_DATA_PERSISTENCE.md.
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

# Blockchain RPC URL (optional - for multi-PC: point this PC to another PC's node)
# Default: http://127.0.0.1:8545 (local Hardhat). To see data from other PCs (e.g. prescriptions
# and batches created there), run the blockchain on ONE PC and set this to that PC's IP:
# VITE_DEV_RPC_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8545
# Use the SAME VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS on all PCs (from deploy on that node).
VITE_DEV_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545

# ---------- Vercel / public deployment (so shared link works for others) ----------
# When you deploy to Vercel and share the link, others see "Hardhat Not Running" unless
# you use a public testnet. Set these in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

# Required for shared Vercel link (no local Hardhat):
# VITE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=true

# Contract must be deployed on the same network (e.g. Sepolia). Deploy once:
# npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
# Then set:
# VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your Sepolia contract address>

# Public RPC for that network (read-only fallback). No API key needed for public RPCs:
# VITE_DEV_RPC_URL=https://rpc.sepolia.org

# Optional: network name for wallet switch (default: sepolia). Options: sepolia, polygon
# VITE_PUBLIC_NETWORK=sepolia

# After adding these, redeploy on Vercel. Users will see "Connect MetaMask" instead of "Hardhat Not Running".
